            WHAT EXACTLY IS PROACTIVE MONITORING?
            <span class="divider-first"></span>
            With the plethora of digitalized services and conveniences available, the concerns over privacy, security, and the “what’s next?” quickly becomes apparent. The masses and businesses alike, have increasingly moved over to the comfort of automated processes and operations, with personal hands-on involvement being included only when absolutely needed. And the transition, once adapted by those with the financial capacity and resources enough to do so, has fast moved beyond these means of limitations towards the developing countries that were wary of the take over of technology and the insufficient resources needed to take everyday basic services online.  
            <span class="divider"></span>

            E-commerce, for instance, started off on a strong point decades before most of the world was even familiar with the concept of purchasing products online. The industry is now thriving steadily, seeing one of its all-time highs through the 2020 lockdown, coupled with a wave of bored stay-at-homers with plenty of time to explore new products and interests. So why wasn’t the healthcare industry following in its steps during this time, when its services aren’t just an essential service sought out during a pandemic, but an everyday need for everyone?
            <span class="divider"></span>

            At a time when all these data-loving algorithms and analytics play a crucial, yet unavoidable role in just about everything, healthcare data is the one thing that can’t be capitalized on. In-built smartphone apps dedicated to logging and tracking healthcare data are committed to ensuring and acknowledging the end-to-end encryption protocols and security features. But the question persists; at which stage can the hospitals and healthcare professionals intervene? 

            <span class="divider"></span>

            Technology today knows no bounds– and the healthcare industry is yet to leverage this to the highest capacity possible for those involved, like the patients, doctors and the hospital. While smartphone apps have laid the groundwork for logging healthcare activity and records, accessibility, convenience and consistency in service are a rarity in healthcare in most regions. 
            <span class="divider"></span>

            Digitalizing this spectrum could significantly improve the experience for an entire industry. A centralized platform where a patient can keep track of their appointments, consultations, upcoming surgeries and prescriptions will surely make the entire process efficient and easy to track for the hospital, patient and doctor all the same. Developing countries are facing a shortage in the already-low numbers of specialized doctors, but we unanimously agree that patients still deserve the right to proper healthcare. 
            <span class="divider"></span>

            Where every individual is equipped with a smartphone, allowing remote consultations with doctors worldwide and locally would bring healthcare access to even the less-privileged. Test results, opinions on the patient's analysis, prescriptions issued and medicine schedules and logs could then be easily stored and tracked for future purposes, allowing access to the assigned doctor and the hospital. Payments could be made with ease via bank transfer or card payment gateways, leading to a user experience that skips past pesky queues and canceled appointments. With optimized security ensuring the highest privacy on the healthcare data stored, our platform WellPlex will be all this, and more. Stay connected through our social media as we navigate this exciting and much-awaited chapter in healthcare, because your well-being should never be put on hold.
